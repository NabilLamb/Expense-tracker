# Expense Tracker App

## Overview
The **Expense Tracker App** is a personal finance management tool that allows users to track their expenses efficiently. Users can add, update, and delete expenses, categorize them, and view summary charts to analyze spending patterns. The app leverages **React.js** for a dynamic user interface, **Chart.js** or **ECharts** for visualizations, and **localStorage** for data persistence.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations:** Add, update, and delete expenses.
- **Categorization:** Assign expenses to predefined or custom categories (e.g., Food, Transportation, Entertainment).
- **Visualization:** Interactive charts (pie, bar, or line) for expense summary and trends.
- **Filters:** View expenses by category or date range.
- **Data Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to retain expense data across sessions.
- **Customizable Categories:** Create and manage personal expense categories.

## Tech Stack
- **React.js:** For building the user interface.
- **Chart.js** or **ECharts:** For rendering dynamic charts and graphs.
- **localStorage:** For storing expense data persistently on the client side.
